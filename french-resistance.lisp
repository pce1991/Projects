;I could maybe make paths like for 314. (home (cafe 2) (eiffel-tower 10)). This would get rid of the need for the player to draw

;so there's essentiall a home-street, cafe-street, etcetera, and each path has a distance, maybe a traffic-rating (changing based on the day?)
;and these numbers will affect the possiblity of encountering resistance. I think certain locations should also have a possibility of being
;occupied, so perhaps you go to a cafe to join the resistance, but there are some soldiers there. Maybe this is what I should keep
