As things more data gets fed in, the chances of finding strange and even error-prone connections may increase. It's imperative that I find a way to display how the connections are made to the user. I could imagine this being really common ny comparing dictionaries, where a word might be connected to one in another language, seemingly for no reason to the user, but behind the program the connection exists for some valid reason.
